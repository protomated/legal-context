## Overview

LegalContext is an open-source Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that creates a secure, standardized bridge between law firms' document management systems (specifically Clio) and AI assistants (starting with Claude Desktop). It enables AI tools to access, retrieve, and incorporate firm document context while maintaining complete security and control over sensitive information.

**Key Value Proposition**: Transform AI from a liability risk into a trusted legal assistant by ensuring all AI responses are grounded in your firm's actual documents and expertise.

## The AI Hallucination Crisis in Legal Practice

AI hallucinations pose a critical risk in legal settings, as evidenced by several high-profile cases:

- A recent Stanford study found that even the latest legal AI tools hallucinate in 1 out of 6 (or more) queries, despite using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). While some legal tech companies claim their tools are "hallucination-free," Stanford researchers found that LexisNexis and Thomson Reuters AI tools each hallucinate between 17% and 33% of the time. [Source: [Stanford HAI](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/ai-trial-legal-models-hallucinate-1-out-6-or-more-benchmarking-queries), [Stanford Law School](https://law.stanford.edu/publications/hallucination-free-assessing-the-reliability-of-leading-ai-legal-research-tools/)]

- Federal judges have imposed serious sanctions on attorneys for relying on AI hallucinations. In one Manhattan case, two New York lawyers were fined $5,000 for submitting fictional cases generated by ChatGPT. A Texas lawyer was ordered to pay a $2,000 penalty and attend AI education courses after citing nonexistent cases and fabricated quotations. [Source: [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/ai-hallucinations-court-papers-spell-trouble-lawyers-2025-02-18/), [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/litigation/lawyer-sanctioned-over-ai-hallucinated-case-cites-quotations)]

- Lawyers at Morgan & Morgan, one of the nation's largest personal injury firms, faced sanctions when their internal AI platform "hallucinated" fake cases. The judge fined the primary attorney $3,000 and revoked his temporary admission to practice. [Source: [ABA Journal](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/no-42-law-firm-by-headcount-could-face-sanctions-over-fake-case-citations-generated-by-chatgpt), [Clio Blog](https://www.clio.com/blog/ai-hallucination-case/)]

- These incidents led Morgan & Morgan to send an urgent email to its more than 1,000 lawyers warning that "Artificial intelligence can invent fake case law, and using made-up information in a court filing could get you fired." [Source: [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/ai-hallucinations-court-papers-spell-trouble-lawyers-2025-02-18/)]

- As Judge Marcia Crone noted, "The duties imposed by Rule 11 require that attorneys read, and thereby confirm the existence and validity of, the legal authorities on which they rely." Multiple courts have emphasized that AI use does not excuse attorneys from their professional responsibility to verify sources.

## How LegalContext Solves This Problem

LegalContext addresses the hallucination crisis through a fundamentally different approach to AI document integration:

### 1. Firm-Specific Document Grounding

Unlike generic RAG systems or public legal databases, LegalContext:
- Connects directly to your firm's Clio document management system
- Makes your firm's proprietary knowledge and precedents available to Claude
- Ensures AI responses are based on your actual documents, not imagined cases
- Creates an institutional memory accessible to all your attorneys

### 2. Secure Local Processing

All document processing occurs completely within your firm's security perimeter:
- Zero document content transmitted to external servers
- No sensitive data exposed to third parties
- Complies with client confidentiality requirements
- Maintains Clio's existing security model and permissions

### 3. Citation Tracking & Verification

Every statement generated by the AI is transparently linked to its source:
- Automatic citation of specific firm documents
- Clear attribution to enable verification
- Prevention of unsourced claims
- Audit trail for AI-generated content

### Why LegalContext Is Different

While many solutions claim to solve the AI hallucination problem, they fall short in key ways:

1. **Superior to Existing RAG Systems**
   - A June 2024 Stanford study found that even leading RAG-based legal AI tools from LexisNexis and Thomson Reuters hallucinate 17-33% of the time
   - Generic RAG systems rely on text similarity rather than legal relevance
   - LegalContext grounds AI responses in your firm's actual knowledge, not public databases

2. **Better Than Clio Duo**
   - Complements rather than competes with Clio's native AI
   - Provides integration with Claude's advanced capabilities
   - Allows flexibility in AI assistant choice
   - Works with your existing document management system

3. **More Secure Than Cloud Solutions**
   - No sensitive data transmitted outside your firm
   - Complete control over document access
   - Maintains existing security permissions
   - Protects client confidentiality

```

### Testing

The project includes several types of tests to ensure quality and reliability:

#### Unit Tests

Run unit tests to verify individual components:

```bash
# Run all unit tests
bun run test

# Run tests with coverage report
bun run test:cov

# Run tests in watch mode during development
bun run test:watch
```

#### Integration Tests

Test interaction between components:

```bash
# Run integration tests
bun run test:integration
```

#### End-to-End Tests

Test complete flows from Claude Desktop to Clio and back:

```bash
# Run e2e tests
bun run test:e2e
```

#### Mock Clio API

For development and testing, you can use the mock Clio API server:

```bash
# Start mock Clio API server
bun run start:mock-clio
```

This provides a simulated Clio API environment with test documents and OAuth endpoints.

### Deployment

LegalContext supports multiple deployment options:

#### Docker Deployment

The simplest way to deploy is using Docker Compose:

```bash
# Build and start production containers
docker-compose up -d legalcontext-prod
```

This will set up PostgreSQL with pgvector and the MCP server in production mode.

#### Manual Deployment

For on-premises deployment:

1. **Build the production version**

```bash
bun run build
```

2. **Configure environment**

Ensure all environment variables are set correctly for production.

3. **Set up PostgreSQL**

Install PostgreSQL with pgvector extension and run the initialization scripts.

4. **Start the server**

```bash
NODE_ENV=production bun run start:prod
```

#### Scaling Considerations

- For increased document capacity, consider upgrading to PostgreSQL with more CPU and RAM
- For multiple users, ensure the server has sufficient concurrent connection capacity
- Consider using a load balancer for high-availability deployments
- Implement proper backup strategies for the PostgreSQL database

#### Monitoring and Maintenance

- Set up health checks to monitor the MCP server
- Schedule regular backups of the PostgreSQL database
- Implement log rotation for audit logs
- Create an update strategy for security patches
