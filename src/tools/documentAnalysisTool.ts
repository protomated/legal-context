Contract Risk Analysis for Johnson Service Agreement:

1. CRITICAL RISK: Service scope has ambiguous deliverables timeline with no specific milestones
2. HIGH RISK: Payment terms with net-60 (our standard is net-30)
3. HIGH RISK: Limited liability cap at fee amount only, below our standard minimum
4. HIGH RISK: Broad indemnification requirements expose client to third-party claims
5. MEDIUM RISK: Unilateral termination rights for Johnson Corp with minimal notice
6. MEDIUM RISK: Inconsistent governing law provisions between sections
7. MEDIUM RISK: Missing confidentiality provisions for shared intellectual property
8. LOW RISK: Automatic renewal without notification period

Risk Score: 78/100 (High Risk)

Recommendations:
- Renegotiate service scope with specific deliverable dates
- Request standard net-30 payment terms
- Increase liability cap to at least 2x contract value
- Limit indemnification to direct third-party IP claims only
- Equalize termination rights with standard 30-day notice
- Standardize governing law to our preferred jurisdiction
- Add confidentiality clause with 3-year post-termination protection
- Add 30-day renewal notification requirement

Common Risk Factors in Our Software Licensing Agreements:

1. License Scope: Often contains vague language around authorized users
2. IP Ownership: 40% of agreements have unclear ownership of derivative works
3. Warranty: Most contain limited warranties below industry standard
4. Liability: 70% have acceptable liability caps, but 30% have inadequate protection
5. Support Terms: Frequently missing clear SLA definitions
6. Exit Terms: Often lacks proper data migration provisions
7. Force Majeure: Standard clauses but pandemic-specific language still absent in older templates

Industry Comparison:
- Our liability caps average 2x annual fees (industry standard is 3x)
- Our warranty periods average 60 days (industry standard is 90 days) 
- Our termination notice averages 30 days (industry standard is 60 days)

Improvement Recommendations:
- Update user definition templates to include clear affiliate/subsidiary language
- Implement standard 90-day warranty language across templates
- Increase standard liability caps to 3x annual fees
- Add detailed SLA metrics with specific remedy paths
- Develop standard exit/transition assistance language
